# Davizmal

Davizmal stands for Data visualization markup language. It provides an easy way to describe visualizations of data such as plots, graphs, pies, etc in SVG or PNG format. Data can be provided inline in the davizmal file, as arguments when building the visualization, or as a pair of CSV and YAML files. Hence, a single davizmal file can be used as a template to apply to multiple datasets and export as many visualizations.
